<h1>My mission</h1>

        <a>My mission in life is to make it easier for billions of people to learn English in the future<br>
        The sad reality is that the current state of English language teaching around the world is not very good. <br>
        
        I want to change that. <br>

        I have many ideas about how to make it easier for people to learn English, ranging from specific improvements in
        how grammar is taught to improvements in how schools operate. <br>
        
        However, the area in which I plan to have the most immediate impact is in the area of 
       pronunciation and the International Phonetic Alphabet <br>
